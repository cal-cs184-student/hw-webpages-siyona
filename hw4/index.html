      Changing the spring constant seems to effect how quickly the cloth gets
      back into place. While I did not notice a huge difference with a really
      low ks (which may be due to the 10% change in distance implementation), I
      did notice that with a really high ks, the cloth when changed to that ks
      seems to shake violently for a second to whip into shape which makes sense
      as the ks is very high and is likely changing the position very fast for
      many points somewhat arbitrarily when looking at them as a whole (see
      photo).
      <br />
      <br />
      Changing the density to be very low seemed to have a large effect when the
      cloth reached a near rest state - it took longer to finally rest and in
      the case of the density being too low it seems to violently shake a the
      bottom. This makes sense because a small force would have a large effect
      on a very non-dense cloth. Comparatively, a high density leads to the
      cloth settling at the bottom quickly.
      <br />
      <br />
      Changing the damping to be low causes the cloth fall quickly, and when
      very low, it flails (see the image above where it flails back and forth)
      in a pendulum like motion. A very high dampling does not lead to flailing
      and instead the cloth falls very slowly. This is because the dampling is
      inversely proportional to the change in position experienced by each
      point. Thus a high dampling causes a low change in position and vise
      versa.

      <h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
      To implement the collision between the cloth and the sphere (3.1), 
I followed the steps provided in the spec. I found the distance from the Point Mass’s position 
from the origin of the sphere and if that was less than the radius of the sphere. If it was, 
I bumped the position of the Point Mass by finding the tangent point, then subtracting the pm’s 
last position from the tangent point. Then, I reset the point’s position by adding the point mass’s 
last position to (1-f) multiplied by the correction vector. I used a similar process for the cloth’s collision 
with the plane and found if the cloth was intersected any part of the plane using dot products and used the SURFACE OFFSET 
variable for this calculation.

      <h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
      <p>To implement self-collision, I went through breaking the problem down by each method. Cloth::hash_position mapped each position (as how it is described in the spec) to a 3D grid and gave each position a hash key that was an identifier for the position within the hash table. 
	      Then, in Cloth::build_spatial_map, I put all of the point masses into position by looping over all of them with a for loop and then calling Cloth::hash_position 
	      on each point mass. This was (as described in Cloth::hash_position spec notes) each point mass has a unique position in the map. Then, for the final method Cloth::self-collide, I looped over all of the point masses in the map and if two adjacent particles were less than 
	      2∗thickness apart, I made a correction vector adjusted the position of the particles. I also updated Cloth::simulate to build the spatial map and call self_collide on all of the point masses. </p>

<p>When the density was increased, the cloth fell as if it had more weight to it, so the folds sagged more, and the cloth didn't fold on itself in its resting state. When the spring constant was decreased, the cloth fell quicker and bundled more in its resting state</p>

      <h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
	    Shader programs affect how images are rendered and displayed. They affect the lighting, color, and texture of the objects that are rendered on the screen. To create these
lighting and material effects, we use vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders move vertexes from object space to screen space and compute lighting per vertex shown on the screen. 
Fragment shaders compute the color of the rendered image and lighting effects (like those used in the Blinn-Phong model).

	    The Blinn-Phong model is a model used to create a shiny/glossy effect when rendering images. Through three different types of lighting, ambient, diffuse, and specular, it 
is able to achieve the intended effect. It utilizes light direction vectors, reflected light, and light intensity through the equation shown in the spec and in lecture. It is implemented below.

The two approaches both incorporated textures and the Blinn-Phong Model in order to include the lighting. However, in implementation, the vertex shaders of both were different. Visually, you can see this in the jaggies created in the displacement picture. 
For the different coarseness levels, the differences are more visible for displacement mapping because the shape (specifically the edges) of the sphere changes.
