		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Through this homework, we implemented the rendering pipeline for complex objects given the primitves which make them up and a camera location (as well)
		as the BSDF of certain materials. As such, we implemented a bounding volume hierarchy through which we could effectively determine
		ray intersection in the scene. Direct illumination and subsequently, global illumination were implemented to provide realistic lighting in the scene
		during rendering and finally adaptive sampling was implemented to increase efficiency in rendering. One cool part about this project was being able to set so many 
		options for how we wanted to render the image and I particularly thought implementing global illumination was really cool. It was neat to see the effect different
		m levels had on the render and the lighting at that ray depth individually.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		<h3>Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.</h3>
		<p>
			The ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline come at the very beginning. Essentially,
			they are the base for which we can apply later parts of the project such as direct illumination, global illumination, etc.
			Firstly, we use ray generation from the camera origin to determine which elements should be rendered (and visible) by tracing
			the rays/line of vision of the camera. First, we generate rays by converting a series of normalized image (x, y) coordinates to camera space
			coordinates (using the bounds provided in the spec) and then use the camera to world matrix to transform those coodinates to world space
			before finally normalizing them so the provided ray starts from the origin and is normalized. Then per each pixel, we can sample some N 
			points and generate rays in those directions to set up for testing primitive intersection. The primitives we are concerned with (which make up the
			provided files) are triangles and spheres. We first need to use the rays we have generated to test if they intersect with a primitive (and if so, at
			what t value so we know what the closest in-frame intersection is) so we can determine which points to render and how to light it given
			the normal vector at the intersection (we call the brdf when we see an intersection which should then be rendered). We do not
			test intersections ray-by-ray, but rather primitive by primitive.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.</h3>
		<p>The triangle intersection algorithm I used was built off the MÃ¶ller Trumbore algorithm provided in the lecture slides. Because this 
			algorithm produces both the t value of the intersection as well as the barycentric coordinates, I was able to determine both whether an
			intersection occurred as well as the t value of the intersection (to know if it is in frame and closest) by calculating the t, b1, and b2 values
			according to the equation:
		</p>
		<img src="./q1/mollertrumbore.png" width="400px"></img>
		<p> Then, to determine if the intersection occurred, I determined if all three barycentric coordinates (the third of which can be determined
			from the other two) were all in the range 0 to 1 which would signify the intersection is inside the triangle. If the t was greater than min_t
			and less than max_t, then the intersection is also in view and the new closest intersection. To calculate the normal vector, the barycentric coordinates
			can be used to interpolate the normal vectors at the vertices across the triangle \[ \alpha * n_1 + \beta * n_2 + \gamma * n_3 \]

			As such this algorithm was implemented in our code, the specifics of which are very simple.

		  <p>As seen above, the number of samples per light area plays a large role in making shadows less noisy. With only one sample 
			per light area (and one sample per pixel as used in the images above), if the single cast light ray does not intersect with the light, this 
			causes the direct lighting estimate to be black. Conversely, if it does, it reflects the light using the bsdf. As such, there is no 
			blending or smoothness of shadows in the l == 1 example and it is extremely noisy. When l == 4 this is still an issue but there is significant 
			improvement as the noise does not go quite as far from the bunny. When l == 16, the shadow seems to start converging to the correct area, but 
			there is still a little bit of noise surrounding the shadow. When l == 64, te shadow looks fairly realistic and while the noise may still minorly exist, this is 
			likely at this point due to the one sample per pixel.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Comparing uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling</h3>
		  <p>Uniform hemisphere sampling when applying direct lighting is very inefficient/may require significantly more rendering time and samples
			to produce an image which is not noisy. This is because, unlike lighting sampling, the ray we cast can intersect anywhere or not intersect with 
			the scene at all. In order to get an estimate for the lighting at that area, we need to simply hope that the cast ray intersects a light source
			and therefore it takes longer to converge and also causes noise when sample rates are low. Lighting sampling contrarily directly casts rays in the 
			direction of light sources which is effective in determing direct lighting. Because we don't have to worry about a large amount of rays which don't
			intersect the scene or a light source at all, we can be more confident the image converges with fewer samples and the noise is not present. The results
			I've described can be seem in the above images where uniform hemisphere sampling clearly leads to a more noisy image.
		  </p>

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		<h3>Walk through your implementation of the indirect lighting function</h3>
		<p>To implement the direct lighting function with Russian roulette, I used the pseudocode from the slides:</p>
		<img src="./q4/indirect_lighting_pseudocode.png" width="400px"></img>
		<p>Intuitively, it works as follows. First, we determine the one bounce radiance on the given point. That is added to our L_out (see note below about <code>isAccumBounce</code>)
		Then, determine a sample direction using <code>sample_f</code>. This both populates
		the <code>w_i</code> field (object coordinates) as well as the <code>pdf</code> which can be used later. The w_i is then converted to
		world coordinates. Using the sampled w_i which is a new bounce, we can generate a ray from the current point we hit, <code>hit_p</code>, as 
	    the origin, and use the normalized w_i as the direction. This is the new ray we will (possibly) recurse on and add lighting from. Before
	    recursing, we need to test the ray intersects the scene. If it does, we can calculate the bsdf of (w_out, w_i). We also determine
	    out <code>cos_theta</code> value. Finally, to implement russian roulette, we can use the <code>coin_flip(p)</code> function to recurse with 
	    probability p. We set our continutation probability to 0.7. If the result of the flip is true, we recurse on the newly generated ray and intersection (populated by our ray-scene intersection test)
	    and sum the values to L_out according to the pseudocode above. <b>Some important notes as to how <code>max_depth</code> and <code>isAccumBounce</code>
		were implemented:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>For the newly generated ray, we set the depth to the old ray depth minus one. The initial ray depth is set in <code>raytrace_pixel</code> to
			<code>max_depth</code>. When the input ray depth is 0, we do not recurse. We return a zero vector.</li>
			<li>When <code>isAccumBounce</code> is false, we do not add the <code>one_bounce_radiance</code> at the current depth. We directly return
			the <code>one_bounce_radiance</code> when the current ray depth is 1 (because this makes it the final depth). We also always return the value of the
			next bounce and do not sum it to a total when input ray depth is greater than 1 (that is, if we make it that far due to ray-scene intersection and Russian roulette).</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>In the above comparison, we can see that while the direct lighting arguably provides most of the lighting in the scene,
			indrect lighting still plays a large role in lighting covered areas (from the light source) and imparting reflectant color
			on certain parts of the scene. There is quite a lot missing without the indirect lighting. Neither scene, however, looks realistic
			individually.

		</div>
		<p>In the above table, what I can see for the second bounce of light when <code>isAccumBounces=false</code> is that the second
		bounce of light (<code>m == 2</code>) seems to contribute a lot of hue onto the ground and a little bit onto the bunny itself. It also
		seems to be very important for lighting certain areas which are not in the direct path of the light, which ends up lightening the shadow under the bunny.
		The third bounce of light, similarly, provides additional lighting to the image and seems to make some areas of the image a little bit
		more sharp. While the difference when it is added is small, it certainly fills in the gaps in certain areas (figuratively speaking).
	
		As the m value increases, while it is clear that the unaccumulated bounces seem to provide significantly less lighting each time, the quality of the 
		accumulated image increases each time, however minutely as m increases. In my opinion, there is not a large difference between m == 2 and m == 5.

		<p>As seen above, the number of samples per pixel plays a very significant role in decreasing graininess in the image. The image
			rendered with 1024 samples per pixel is extremely smooth, though costly to run (which is optimized in the next section!). However, all 
			images with a lower sample rate seem to be a bit grainy (64 and below). When s == 64, the image is very clear, but there is a little bit of
			roughness as it appears around the image. When s is even lower, the balls look extremely staticy and for an s below 8 it seems like there are certain 
			areas of the image which did not render correctly or have a ray sampled at all. The s == 1 image is extremely grainy and missing rendering in many areas.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		<h3>Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of adaptive sampling</h3>
		Adaptive sampling is a method through which we can possibly improve render times or focus our sampling on areas which need
		more samples to properly converge without wasting compute on areas which converge very quickly. The idea is essentially to 
		keep track of the mean and variance of the samples and thus use this to create a confidence interval with a max width between
		ends of the interval determined by the maxTolerance variable. Thus, if the distribution of samples in a certain pixel is very
		close, after some low number of samples, we can say with high confidence that the current sample is very close to the true value
		so we don't need to keep sampling. For samples which take longer to converge, we will not break so quickly.
		<br>
		<br>
		To implement this, in the <code>raytrace_pixel()</code> function, I've keep track of the sum of illuminances and the sum of squared illuminances (<code>s1, s2</code>).
		From this, every <code>samplesPerBatch</code> samples, I calculate the mean and variance, which I then use to calculate <code>I</code> and determine
		if the <code>I</code> value is less than the max tolerance times the mean.
		
		All equations used are provided in the spec. For reference, I is calculated as \[ I = 1.96 * \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]
		
		If <code>I</code> is small enough, the current number of total samples is recorded and the loop
		breaks because we don't have to sample any further as the sample has converged. Then, the sample count buffer is updated with the total samples
		for this pixel and the total_radiance is divided by that number (NOT <code>num_samples</code>). If the <code>I</code> value is greater, continue.
